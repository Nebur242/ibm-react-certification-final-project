# üåø Paradise Nursery Shopping Application

This repository contains the code for the **Paradise Nursery** front-end shopping application. This project was developed as part of the final project for the React App Development course. The application allows users to browse a collection of houseplants, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their selections before proceeding to checkout.

## üåç Live Demo

## üéØ Project Overview

The **Paradise Nursery** app is a simple e-commerce web application that showcases a variety of houseplants. It features a dynamic user interface built with **React.js**, allowing users to interact with products and manage their shopping cart in real-time. The app includes three main pages: a landing page, a product listing page, and a shopping cart page.

### Features

- **Landing Page**: 
  - Displays a welcoming background image.
  - A brief introduction about Paradise Nursery.
  - A prominent "Get Started" button leading to the product listing page.
  
- **Product Listing Page**:
  - Displays at least six houseplants, grouped into three or more categories.
  - Each plant features a thumbnail image, name, and price.
  - Includes an "Add to Cart" button for each plant.
  - A dynamic shopping cart icon in the header showing the total number of items in the cart.
  
- **Shopping Cart Page**:
  - Shows the selected plants with details (name, price, thumbnail image, quantity).
  - Allows users to increase or decrease the quantity of each item in the cart.
  - Provides a "Delete" button for removing items.
  - Dynamically updates the cart total and quantity of items.
  - Includes a "Continue Shopping" and a "Checkout" button.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React.js**: The primary framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation between pages (Landing, Product Listing, and Cart).
- **CSS**: Styling the components and ensuring responsiveness.
- **State Management**: Utilizing `Redux/toolkit`, `useState` and `useEffect` for managing application state and side effects.

## üìù Final Thoughts
This project was a great opportunity to implement the skills I learned throughout the course, particularly in React.js and component-based architecture. The Paradise Nursery application simulates the core functionality of a small-scale e-commerce store, focusing on plants and gardening. Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of React state management, dynamic UI updates, and page routing.
